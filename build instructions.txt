Perfect! Since you're okay with **GitHub Pages**, here's how to deploy your **React-based IT industry landing page** live using GitHub Pages. 🚀

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Deploy React App to GitHub Pages

---

### 🔧 1. **Create Your React App (If Not Already)**

If you haven’t created it yet:

```bash
npx create-react-app tech-landing --template typescript
cd tech-landing
```

> Paste your landing page code inside `src/App.tsx` or as a component in `src/components`.

---

### 📦 2. **Install GitHub Pages Package**

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

---

### 🛠️ 3. **Update `package.json`**

Add the following fields:

#### A. Add a homepage URL (replace `yourusername`):

```json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/tech-landing"
```

#### B. Add scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

---

### 💾 4. **Push Project to GitHub**

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `tech-landing`)
2. Initialize and push your code:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/tech-landing.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```

---

### 🚀 5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:

* Build the React app
* Push the build to the `gh-pages` branch
* Host it at:
  📍 `https://yourusername.github.io/tech-landing`

---

### 🔄 6. (Optional) Re-deploy after changes

Every time you make changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
npm run deploy
```

---

## ✅ That’s it! 🎉 Your website is live on GitHub Pages.
